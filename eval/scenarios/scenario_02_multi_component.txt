Design an internal portal page that lets a release manager:
- View current release train status (phases: plan, build, test, deploy)
- See a kanban of open release tasks (columns: Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- Inspect a chart of error rate over last 24h
- Trigger a "Generate Release Notes" action
Return a structured UI plan.
